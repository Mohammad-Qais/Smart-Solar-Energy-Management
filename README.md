# Smart-Solar-Energy-Management
Arduino Microcontroller code for controling the solar energy system.

The solar panel is made to continuously adjust its orientation by a servo motor, the panel itself acts as a sensor and tells the motor how to move.
The aim was to always have the solar panel facing the sun directly to recieve most intensity.
This was a project submitted in first year of my college. It is not perfect, it just works. 

### Parts used:
Arduino Microcontroller
Red LED 20mA
Servo Motor SG90
Breadboard
Jumper wires
A small solar panel

The circuit diagram for assembling parts is provided. 

Note: We did not use a current sensor for this project and directly connected the solar panel to the arduino. Due to the small scale of the project, it somehow worked but it probably wont work if you try it.

The project was completed in a team of four and I was handling the coding part. Also this was inspired by AKIO TV on youtube.com
